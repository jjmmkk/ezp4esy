_eZ Publish 4.x Extension Skeleton, Yessir_

## Abstract

Automate the setting up of extensions while imposing supposed best practices.

## Todo

* Namespaces
	* Might have to start at "class\"
	* Might break _function_definition.php_
* _module.php_
	* Attempt to move configuration to a class - at least the view URLs
	* `$FunctionList`
	* `'params' => array( 'paramKey' => 'paramKey' ),`
* Template operators through as class, as done by eZ
* Silly two character prefix of navigation part
* _\_view.php_
	* Attempt to move path configuration to a class
